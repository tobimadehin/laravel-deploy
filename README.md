## Angular and Laravel Application Deployment on Digital Ocean Droplet

### Overview
This guide outlines the steps to deploy an Angular frontend and a Laravel backend application on a Digital Ocean droplet. By following these instructions, you'll be able to set up and configure your server to host both the frontend and backend components of your application.

### Prerequisites
- A Digital Ocean account
- Basic understanding of Angular and Laravel development
- Familiarity with Linux server administration and command line interface

### Steps
1. **Create a Digital Ocean Droplet**
   - Log in to your Digital Ocean account and create a new droplet.
   - Choose the desired operating system (e.g., Ubuntu) and configuration for your droplet.

2. **SSH Into Your Droplet**
   - Once your droplet is created, SSH into it using the provided IP address and your SSH key.

3. **Install Required Software**
   - Update the package list: `sudo apt update`
   - Install Nginx web server: `sudo apt install nginx`
   - Install PHP and required extensions for Laravel: `sudo apt install php php-cli php-fpm php-mysql php-json php-mbstring php-xml php-zip unzip`

4. **Configure Nginx**
   - Configure Nginx to serve your Angular frontend and Laravel backend applications. You'll need to create server blocks for each application.

5. **Install Composer (for Laravel)**
   - Install Composer, a PHP dependency manager, by following the instructions on the Composer website.

6. **Deploy Laravel Backend**
   - Clone your Laravel project repository onto the server.
   - Install dependencies using Composer: `composer install`
   - Set up environment variables and configure your `.env` file.
   - Run database migrations and seeders if necessary: `php artisan migrate --seed`
   - Configure Nginx to serve your Laravel application.

7. **Deploy Angular Frontend**
   - Build your Angular project locally: `ng build --prod`
   - Transfer the built files to your server using SCP or another file transfer method.
   - Configure Nginx to serve your Angular application.

8. **Secure Your Server**
   - Configure firewall rules to allow only necessary incoming traffic.
   - Enable HTTPS by obtaining an SSL certificate and configuring Nginx to use it.

9. **Test Your Deployment**
   - Access your server's IP address in a web browser to verify that both the Angular frontend and Laravel backend are functioning correctly.

10. **Monitor and Maintain**
    - Set up monitoring and logging to keep track of server performance and errors.
    - Regularly update your server's software to ensure security and stability.
